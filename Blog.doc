Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
HTTP1.1	HTTP2
•	One response per connection 	•	Multiple response over one connection 
•	3 TCP connection 	•	1 TCP connection 
•	[1997]; introduced persistent connection, pipelining, cache-control and many other features 	•	[2015]; based on Google’s SPDY allows multiplexing and server push 
•	Again, and again until all data is sent from browser to server	•	With one connection open all requested data is sent over from browser to server 
•	It is relatively secure since it uses digest authentication, NTLM authentication 	•	Security concerns from previous versions will continue to be seen in HTTP/2. However it is better equipped to deal with them due to new TLS features like connection error of type

Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.
Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
